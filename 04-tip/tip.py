# Get input for the check amount.
# Convert to float.


# Get input for the tip percent. Convert to int.


# Calculate the tip amount.  Don't forget to divide by 100 to a *real* percent.


# Print the tip results in the format `A PCT% tip on $CHECK is $AMOUNT`. Except
# for the tip PCT (which should be an int), just let the number of decimal
# places run long or short. We'll learn how to round and format these numbers
# later. You may want to construct an output string a step at a time to avoice a
# really long concatenation.

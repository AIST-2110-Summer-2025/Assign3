# Create a Seating Label

In the file `label.py` implement a program that prompts the user for a first
name, a last name, and a job title. Then print out a "Label" that will have the
form:

```
last_name, first_name
title
```

For example, you might run your program and the interaction would go as follows:

```
Enter a first name: Jacob
Enter a last name: Jensen
Enter a job title: Janitor
```

And the output would be:

```
Jensen, Jacob
Janitor
```

Use `input()` to get data from the user. Three of them. Store that input in
variables. Then use two print() statements to output the variabless as shown.

> **HINT:** you will need to concatenate the last name with a comma and then
> with the first name to get the first line of the label.

Run and test as directed in the README.

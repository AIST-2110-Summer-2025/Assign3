# Hello, world!

Your first task is to write a simple program that outputs the phrase 'Hello, world!' to the console. 
This classic exercise is a traditional starting point for learning any programming language.

- Edit `hello.py` to add your Python code.
- Follow the instructions in the README for the assignment to run and test your
  code.

## Expected Output

When you run your program, the console should display the following text
_**exactly**_:
```
Hello, world!
```

> **Notice that** it is not `hello world`, or `Hello World` or any other
> variation.
